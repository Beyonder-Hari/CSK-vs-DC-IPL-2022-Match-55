<h3> The Toss </h3>
<h4> DC Won the Toss and Elected to Field First </h4>

<h3> Words From The Captains </h3>
<h4>MS Dhoni: We would have bowled first. Toss is not in our control. When there are a few changes after a big auction, sometimes you need to see what is the best combination.
 Jadeja is not fit. Dube comes in.
Rishabh Pant: We want to chase. The season has been up and down. It is going to be a good match. I have learnt a lot from MS Dhoni. Let's see how I execute them. 
Two changes for us. KS Bharat comes in for Mandeep and Axar Patel is in for Lalit Yadav.</h4>
